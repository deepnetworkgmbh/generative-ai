## Prompt Engineering

To improve the quality of the output you can:

* Put the instructions in the beginning instead of the end (Does not matter with GPT-4)

* Instruct the model to provide predefined replies based on specific conditions or situations (System message).

* Give prompt-completion examples in the prompt (Few-shot learning)
* Put a few words at the end of the prompt to get output in desired format (Priming)
* Use clear syntax
* Break down the task into smaller steps
* Provide grounding data
